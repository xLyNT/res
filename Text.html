			There is Kevin Ho's "<i>Flurf</i>", "<i>Off the Hook</i>", and "<i>Racoon</i>", Joey Burton's "<i>Skater Cut</i>", Huron Low's</br>
			"<i>Firefly</i>" and "<i>Flicker</i>", Daren Yeow's "<i>Rev 2 Twirl</i>", Bone Ho's "<i>Anaconda</i>" and "<i>Tornado Deck Split</i>",</br>
			Oliver Sogard's "<i>Friffle</i>", Dan Buck's "<i>Vertigo</i>", and many more. Chris Kenner's two-handed "<i>Sybil Cut</i>"</br>
 			flourish uses multiple packets of cards, and is a good example of a popular flourish. It is arguably </br>
			the most well-known and recognized move among cardists, and is a common starting challenge that newbies </br>
			to the art try to take on. But from there, there are all kinds of advanced maneuvers to learn, some almost </br>
			being a sub-genre of their own, such as "isolations".</p>
			<p class="txt1"><h1>A Growing Art Form</h1></p>
			<p>In the last few years, cardistry has enjoyed a huge boom. What was formerly described as "<i>card flourishing</i>",</br> 
			and considered to be an activity used as a filler in a magic performance, has now become its own separate art form.</br>
			Creative and skilled performers are performing moves of increased complexity. And yet anyone can give it a try, </br>
			because the ingredients are simple: as long as you have a good deck of cards, you are ready to go, you can do it anywhere,</br>
			and you are limited only by your imagination, creativity, and manual dexterity.</br>
			As testimony of how big this new art-form is growing, you will find many performance videos and cardistry tutorials on the</br>
			internet. Social media and sites like youtube and instagram have really helped popularize and advance the art, because cardists </br>
			can share their new moves and tutorials and videos with other enthusiasts globally.</br>
			There are even international gatherings of top performers, and over the last few years, </br>
			a <b>Cardistry Con</b> was organized as an international and annual convention for cardistry enthusiasts. </br>
